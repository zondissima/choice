# The Choice
The Choice is a game where two player get throught a number of options to select the best one

## How to play
* The first player access the game and clicks "start"
* A link to send to the second player is generated
* When the second player access the link, she/he makes the first choice
* The first player can then make the second choice
* And so on, until a single option remains

## How it works
The choices are image file contained in a folder under the "assets" folder. The game, by default,
uses the "fruits" folder, but you can add other and start the games entering the first page with the
parameter name "set" and as value the name of the folder to be used.

For example: https://yoursite.com/?set=k1 to use the "k1" folder.

The sets can be things to do, food to eat, place to visits, and so on.

I cannot commit the original material of the commissioned project since it is not appropriate being it
created for couples... you understand (I have the ZIPs anyway...).

Data to track each game is stored in the "data" subfolder.

## How to help
I need to make the game all AJAX without page reload otherwise on iPhone the sounds effects are blocked.
Probably using Vue could be a good choice and a good exercise: someone?
